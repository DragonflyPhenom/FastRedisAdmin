<h3>Why Fast Redis Admin</h3>

<p>
I had created this Fast Redis Admin Panel (FRAP) on Laravel. It will easy in support in future and this guarantees fast operation and convenient extensibility.<br>
The world already have the RedisAdmin, but I had someproblems use it. It doesn't work with a lot of redis keys. Or work vety slowly.<br>
I needed a quick and easy solution. So I decided to make my own simple and fast Redis Admin<br>
</p>

<h3>Install</h3>

<p>
Just clone with repository and use "composer install" for install all dependencies.<br>
Edit .env file. You need write your Redis connection data.<br>
And just use it.<br>
if you not Russian. Click on "Удалить" for delete key. I will fix it in the future.
</p>

<h3>Future</h3>

<p>
In the future I will make new versions this FRAP.<br>
I will make new GUI and ability to delete groups of keys
